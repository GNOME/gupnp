Changes since 0.12.8:

- Print reason when fail to fetch description doc
- Support for dynamic/multiple networks through a new class, ContextManager.
  This class creates/destroys new context as new network interfaces go up/down.
  It also provides two convenient methods to take care of control point and
  device reference managment for you. Currently we have two implementations of
  context manager:
  * unix: The static but guaranteed to work on Unix, implementation. This is the
          default if none chosen at configure-time.
  * network-manager: A NetworkManager based implementation.
- Idle handlers should use the assigned GMainContext.
- Gracefully handle 'no root element in description' scenerio.
- "host-ip" property moved from GUPnPContext to parent GSSDPClient.
- ControlPoint set itself inactive before getting disposed.
- New function to retrieve the capabilities of a DLNA device as announced in
  the device description.
- New function to retrieve the content of arbitrary elements in the device
  description.
- Fixed a crash that happens when service-proxy goes down before subscribtion to
  it completes.
- Correct condition for SID being NULL.
- Don't create redundant proxies.
- Must not announce earlier versions of resources. This is strictly forbidden
  according to the latest UPnP specs. Instead GSSDP now handles M-SEARCH
  requests independent of version requested.
- Free app developer from hosting of description documents.
- New API to get SoupMessage associated with ServiceAction.
- Handle the SOAPAction header being missing.
- Fixed strrchr result checking.
- Provide and use a wrapper class for xmlDoc objects, GUPnPXMLDoc that is a
  first-class gobject.
- New domains for XML errors.
- Many other minor fixes.

Bugs fixed:

1626 - Print reason when fail to fetch description doc
1769 - audit issues
1760 - missing/invalid SOAPAction header crashes gupnp
1705 - Provide a public API to get information about a GUPnPServiceAction's HTTP
       request

Dependencies changed:

- gssdp >= 0.7
